This is my story

I'm just gonna add a small comment here like this one since all of us
didn't make a story except Saroj, oops. ~Jack

Maybe the story is really a commentary about how we can edit .txt files but are not creative enough to actually write a proper story. ~Zach 

Learning this is somtimes confusing, but fairly interesting. I hope we all learn to be more creative ~Saroj

And now, like everything, it must come to a close. Goodbye.
